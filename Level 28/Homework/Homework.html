        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Aleksander Khomeriki. I'm 13 years old and I live in Tbilisi, Georgia.</p>
        <p>I love sports, especially football and rugby. I play football in a team called FC Vake-Junior, and I was a national champion in table tennis.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My favorite food is burgers, and my favorite color is black. Although I used to enjoy playing games, I don't play them anymore.</p>
        <p>I study programming at Goal Oriented Academy (GOA) in Tbilisi. I aspire to be a footballer when I grow up, and currently, I'm a mini-leader at GOA. I aim to become a leader or a mentor's assistant in the future.</p>
